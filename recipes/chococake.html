    <h1>Gluten-free Chocolate Cake</h1>
    <img src="/home/lawliet/the_odin_project/odin-recipes/recipes/recipegluten-free-chocolate-cake.1024x1024.avif" alt="">
    <p>Ultra-moist, with a fine crumb and intense chocolate flavor, this gluten-free chocolate cake is delicious on its own, but slathered with a maple cream cheese frosting, it’s divine.</p>
    <p>The starch comes from sweet potatoes, making it gluten-free, and since sweet potatoes are packed with vitamins A and C, fiber, calcium and iron, it’s certainly more nutritious than your average chocolate cake. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>700 grams Japanese sweet potato</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>  
        <li> 6 tablespoons cultured unsalted butter (melted)</li>   
        <li>125 grams granulated sugar (~2/3 cup)</li>
        <li>80 grams unsweetened cocoa powder (~2/3 cup)</li>    
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>200 grams cream cheese (at room temperature)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grade b maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Line an 8" x 8" square cake pan with parchment paper and preheat the oven to 375 F (190 C).</li>
        <li>Peel the sweet potato and then grate it into a blender along with the eggs, melted butter, sugar, coco powder, vanilla and salt. Blend until the mixture is smooth and free of lumps.</li>
        <li>Add the baking powder and blend until just combined (don't overmix).</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into your prepared pan, flatten off the top and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (30-40 minutes).</li>
        <li>Let the cake cool for 15 minutes in the pan on a wire rack and then remove the pan, allowing the cake to cool completely.</li>
        <li>For the frosting just whisk together the cream cheese, maple syrup and vanilla until smooth, and spread it on top.</li>
    </ol>
