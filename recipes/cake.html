    <p><b>Matcha Brownies are a vibrant green tea brownie made with white chocolate and matcha powder instead of dark chocolate and cocoa powder. Matcha is a fine powder made from green tea leaves that lends a vibrant green hue to these brownies while lending them a wonderful grassy flavor with just a hint of bitterness. If you like green tea, these sweet treats are the best thing since green tea ice cream, and they make for a fun addition to a basket of holiday baked goods. It’s also worth noting that one of these brownies contains more caffeine than a cup of tea, yet it won’t make you jittery like a cup of coffee will, thanks to a compound called theanine.</b></p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The first thing you want to do is line an 8×8-inch square pan with parchment paper. This makes it much easier to get the green tea brownies out of the pan while they’re still hot, which prevents them from overcooking. I have an easy technique for doing this, which you can check out in the video below.</li>
        <li>Put the oven rack in the middle position and preheat to 320 degrees F (160 C).</li>
        <li>Next, you want to sift the flour, matcha, baking powder, and salt and then whisk them together until the mixture is uniform in color.</li>
        <li>To prepare the liquid ingredients, I start by melting the white chocolate and butter in a microwave set at 300 watts for about a minute and a half.</li>
        <li>Once the chocolate mixture is nice and smooth, beat the eggs into it using a whisk until it’s uniform in color. </li>
        <li>Now you can add the sugar and vanilla extract and whisk it all together until it’s thick and smooth. </li>
        <li>Pour this mixture into the bowl with the flour mixture and fold it together with a spatula until it’s free of lumps. </li>
        <li>Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and level off the top. Bake the Matcha Brownies for 18-20 minutes.</li>

        <li>When the brownies have cooled down completely, you can slice them into bars or squares using a sharp knife. </li>
